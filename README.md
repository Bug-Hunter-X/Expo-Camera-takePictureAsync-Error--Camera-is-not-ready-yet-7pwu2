# Expo Camera `takePictureAsync` Error: Camera not Ready

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API's `takePictureAsync` method. The error, `Camera is not ready yet`, occurs when attempting to take a picture before the camera has fully initialized.  This often happens because of improper timing and asynchronous operations.

The `bug.js` file contains the code exhibiting this issue.  The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version that addresses this problem.

## Problem

The primary issue is accessing `takePictureAsync` too early in the component lifecycle, before the camera permissions have been granted and the camera itself is initialized. The naive approach of calling `takePictureAsync` directly after component mount leads to this error.

## Solution

The solution leverages React's `useEffect` hook and state management to ensure `takePictureAsync` is only called after the camera is ready. This is achieved by:

1.  **Checking Camera Permissions:** Ensuring camera permissions are granted before attempting to use the camera.
2.  **Using a State Variable:** Tracking the camera's readiness using a state variable.  `takePictureAsync` is only called when the state indicates readiness.
3.  **useEffect Hook:**  Ensuring that camera initialization is completed before proceeding with the picture-taking action.

By incorporating these steps, the error is resolved, and the app behaves correctly.
